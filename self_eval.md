# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
>> The exercies went pretty smooth, using the each method was surprisingly easy compared to what I thought it would be. I struggled a little in the beginnnig of the syntax assignment, looking at the hashes sort of scattered about without a lot of structure can be sort of overwhelming. I've struggled a little with doing exercises in order, a few times I've thought I was done, gone back to check and realized I missed an entire exercise. I've been reading the readme files, maybe I'm getting a little tab happy in terminal.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
>>Prereading some of the lessons and taking notes at my own pace has been really helpful for me the last few days. Having a few well organized examples I can go back to when doing exercises makes things a lot faster.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
>>If I have any idea or think I remember the name of a method, I'll try to do it first and then quickly revert to googling if Im wrong. I definitely could hone in my googling some or maybe find a few good references. A lot of the previous searches turned up stuff that wasn't really the issue I was searching for or explained it in too complex of a way for me to understand.
